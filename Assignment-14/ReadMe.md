How did your user testing sessions go?
    They went as well as they could have I suppose. I live in a really rural area, so there wasn't anyone I could sit down with to do this. I ended up deciding to make a google form since a lot of my friends live in different time-zones. It made things easier in the sense of getting multiple responses quickly, but those responses are a lot less detailed than if they had been in-person.

What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?
    As of typing this, I haven't made any changes yet, as my site is still in the skeleton phase. A lot of it involves making assets which is time consuming, so I haven't had time yet to make any more yet.
