1. Structure markup in HTML is the foundation for the website, the head, body, footer, ect. Everything else is built on top of and in reference to the structure. Semantic markup is like the paint or decor, it doesn't change the base of the website, but instead changes the aesthetics and emphasised sections of a site.
