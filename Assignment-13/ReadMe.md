What is the goal of your website? (Think in terms of your user -- why might they visit your site?)

        My website is a bit of a mix between a personal site and a portfolio. Then I could use it when applying for work industry wise, while also including my personal brand for freelance work. Eventually, I want to upload comics onto it as well.

Why is responsive web design important?

    Responsive web design makes users more likely to stay on your site. If it looks and runs nice on their device, they're more likely to stay on it than if it was broken and unappealing due to not being coded to adapt to their screen size.
